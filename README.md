# Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Project Proposal

We are going to work with the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle.  After preparing our data, we will use the AutoGluon library to produce machine learning models and determine which ones work the best for this dataset.  We'll take the top two models and analyze them to determine which model performs the best.  The dataset is highly imbalanced, containing many more legtitimate transactions than fraudulent transactions, so the recommendation from Kaggle is to use Area Under Precision Recall Curve to measure model accuracy.  Once we have our model, we will explore how it could be used to help banks detect credit card fraud with their own data.
